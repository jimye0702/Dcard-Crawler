💥 Karen Teng disrupts the Taiwanese real estate market like nobody else!(中文在下面)

🔜🔜This month’s episode we invited Karen Teng, Co-founder of @House+, to share her journey from academia to running a start-up from scratch.

“It’s been a long-standing issue that the real estate market in Taiwan lacks transparency, and so many Taiwanese couldn't find any reliable information for the house they're interested in.” Karen Teng decided to solve this problem with her expertise in Land Economics and data modeling. Karen and her team created House+, a  free platform that uses scientific methods to provide unbiased housing evaluation for your property.
