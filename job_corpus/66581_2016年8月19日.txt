They want you to be experienced.
They want you to be good at computer.
They want you to be good at communication skills.
they want you to have teamwork spirit.
They want you to have sense of responsibility.
They want you to have good cooperation. (aka. everthing the company said.)
They say that your salary will be 23K.

You say no, you want more resonable break times and salaries.
The companies then threaten the government that they are going to leave this country.
You say BYEEEEEEEE BITCHES!!!!!!!!

When they fired you and leave,
you say: Hey, i'm really sorry. Come back to us. We need you. I'll do anything.

Sadly, we are still the same...
Still in this hell of shame.
