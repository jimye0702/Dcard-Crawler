小弟剛剛在學校信箱莫名收到這封信...
Hi XXXX,

This is PaXX from Dallas, USA. had received your reference from a student at UTA. 

I work as EE/hardware engineer for one of the major companies in Dallas, USA but also own my social media marketing business in USA, Canada & across the globe including Asian countries Australia and Latin America. We have a concept similar to facebook but instead of focusing on social side, we are focusing on business side. I'm working with few students, professionals and entrepreneurs. Currently I m expanding my team in dfw.

Please let me know whats a good voiceline to chat for few minutes and we can exchange some info.

Regards,

PaXX

結果剛剛有回信問他究竟是什麼事情要找我...他附上他的履歷給我，並且說我們背景很像希望可以進一步電話聊...
這樣我該做進一步的聯絡嗎?
總覺得這種寫信的方式蠻突兀的....(目前碩二上還沒有投任何履歷過...不知道他聯絡我是幹嘛...)
