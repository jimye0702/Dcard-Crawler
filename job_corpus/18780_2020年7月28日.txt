我們是一間創新的英語教學工作室，目前還大致上在策劃的階段，我在尋找英語特別強並對人生目標是有很大的衝力的夥伴。
We are a startup that is focused on English training that specifically targets career goals and leadership skills. We want to really bring success to people through learning English. As the executive consultant, I have been developing the curriculum since 2018 and is now putting it to the test. If you successfully obtain a position with us, you will gain invaluable experience through participating in start-up.

I am looking for an intern who is not only passionate but understands that success is about constantly learning and having a vision. I would love to work with someone who's open to explore their talents and able to work outside of their comfort zone. Most importantly, we want someone who is resilient and even without experience, is willing to learn. Keep in mind that we are still in the phases of planning and testing, so there might be unexpected work that requires a lot of attention and effort. We really need someone who is proactive and able to take the initiative to get things done!

Job Description:
We are looking for a Marketing Executive Assistant to assist with extra tasks that the team cannot take on. We are looking to expand our social media platforms so we need someone who is creative and possess excellent communication skills to help our marketing director draft, finalize, and schedule the posts. Although we are looking for an intern, anyone who works well with us has a possibility of staying on the team long term. We are mainly looking for current students, but we also welcome recent graduates!

- Some type of certification or proof of current enrollment in an English program to prove your English proficiency.
